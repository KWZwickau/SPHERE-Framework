##Instructions
The easiest way to install is to find the plugin in the [Piwik Marketplace](http://plugins.piwik.org/).

##Changelog
0.1.2 Tested with Piwik v2.15 and included new registerEvents() hook for compatibility with Piwik 3.0
0.1.1 Cleanup. Removed plugin template verbiage from code files.
0.1.0 Initial Release

##License
GPL v3 / fair use

Develop [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/PiwikPRO/plugin-AdvancedCampaignReporting.svg?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.org/PiwikPRO/plugin-AdvancedCampaignReporting)

## Description

Track up to five Campaigns parameters (name, source, medium, keyword, content), and access Campaign Analytics reports.

### Measuring campaigns

The default Campaign parameters are called: pk_campaign, pk_source, pk_medium, pk_keyword, pk_content and pk_cid.

If you already have URLs tagged with Google Analytics parameters these are supported: utm_campaign, utm_source, utm_medium, utm_term, utm_content and utm_id

An example landing page URL is:
```
/offer?pk_campaign=Best-Seller&pk_source=Newsletter_7&pk_medium=email
```

### Features
 * Real time Analytics Reports of all your Campaign Marketing
 * Detects Campaign parameters from the landing page URL, within the query string or in the #hash string
 * The Referrers>Overview report displays a left column "Referrers Overview" with a list of reports that can be loaded on click.
   This report viewer now also lists the new Campaign reports under "View Referrers by Campaign".
 * The content of Referrers> Campaign will be replaced with the new enhanced Campaigns reports.
 * The default Referrers Campaign widget and API are working as before.
 * The campaign reports are available in Piwik Mobile and can be sent as Scheduled reports (by email, as HTML or PDF)
 * Segment editor: a new "Campaigns" category lists the five new segment for each campaign dimension
 * The new Campaign reports can be added as widgets in your personalized Dashboard
 * Access the Campaign Report data by the API
 * Comes with automated tests to ensure the Plugin works as expected
 * Will track up to 250 characters for each of the five Campaign dimension

### Notes

In the Campaign reports by default Piwik will only archive the first 1000 rows. If you track many campaigns you can configure Piwik so it does not truncate your data. To have data truncated after 10,000 rows, edit your `config/config.ini.php` and add the following:

```
[General]
datatable_archiving_maximum_rows_referrers = 10000
datatable_archiving_maximum_rows_subtable_referrers = 10000
```


### Ideas for improvement
 * To improve data acquisition accuracy, we could extend the piwik.js class to store in first party cookies
 the five campaign dimensions. This would increase the accuracy of Goal conversions and Ecommerce conversions attributions
 for these conversions made at least one day after the first visit with a campaign set. [#10](https://github.com/PiwikPRO/plugin-AdvancedCampaignReporting/issues/10)
 * Add friendly Tracking API parameters to collect campaign dimensions.
 campaignName `cn`, campaignSource `cs`, campaignMedium `cm`, campaignContent `cc`, campaignId `ci`.

## Changelog
 * 1.2.0 (Nov 10th 2015) - Plugin comaptibility with Piwik 2.15.0
 * 1.1.1 (Sept 3rd 2015) - Campaign reports now display your campaign report data even for campaign data before you activated AdvancedCampaignReporting
 * 1.1.0 (July 28th 2015)
 * 1.0.8 (Apr 1st 2015) - Exclude Google Analytics campaign parameters from the Page URLs
 * 1.0.6 (Nov 17th 2014) - Documentation
 * 1.0.5 (Nov 14th 2014) - Detect new URL parameters: piwik_campaign, pk_cpn and for Keywords: pk_kwd, piwik_keyword
 * 1.0.4 (Nov 4th 2014) - View Goals by Campaign Dimension in the Goals & Ecommerce reports

<li>Comes with automated tests to ensure the Plugin works as expected</li>
<li>Will track up to 250 characters for each of the five Campaign dimension</li>
</ul><h3>Notes</h3>

<p>In the Campaign reports by default Piwik will only archive the first 1000 rows. If you track many campaigns you can configure Piwik so it does not truncate your data. To have data truncated after 10,000 rows, edit your <code>config/config.ini.php</code> and add the following:</p>

<pre><code>[General]
datatable_archiving_maximum_rows_referrers = 10000
datatable_archiving_maximum_rows_subtable_referrers = 10000
</code></pre>

<h3>Ideas for improvement</h3>

<ul><li>To improve data acquisition accuracy, we could extend the piwik.js class to store in first party cookies
the five campaign dimensions. This would increase the accuracy of Goal conversions and Ecommerce conversions attributions
for these conversions made at least one day after the first visit with a campaign set. <a href="https://github.com/PiwikPRO/plugin-AdvancedCampaignReporting/issues/10">#10</a></li>
<li>Add friendly Tracking API parameters to collect campaign dimensions.
campaignName <code>cn</code>, campaignSource <code>cs</code>, campaignMedium <code>cm</code>, campaignContent <code>cc</code>, campaignId <code>ci</code>.</li>

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/piwik/plugin-AnonymousPiwikUsageMeasurement.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/piwik/plugin-AnonymousPiwikUsageMeasurement)

## Description

Help us to improve Piwik by sending anonymous usage data of your Piwik service to the creators of Piwik and/or get usage data yourself.

Track usage of your Piwik service into up to three Piwiks:

* [demo-anonymous.piwik.org](https://demo-anonymous.piwik.org) (enabled by default but can be disabled). The tracked data will be used to make Piwik better. Thank you for your help!
* your own Piwik (can be configured optionally)
* a custom Piwik (can be configured optionally)

### What is Piwik doing to make sure the data is anonymized?

We are very careful in what we track and we make sure to anonymize data that could contain user data.

* We overwrite the page title as the title could contain the name of the viewed website
* We remove any referrer information
* We replace URL paramaters with a predefined value apart from a few whitelisted ones to make sure no actual token_auth, CSRF token or user defined value will be tracked
* On demo-anonymous.piwik.org 3 bytes of the IP are anonymised (eg when IP is 192.168.1.1 we track only 192.0.0.0). The original IP is not used to identify your location and provider information is not collected. 
* We do not just track any outlinks or downloads

### When should I not install this plugin?

If you have developed a custom Piwik plugin that contains for example the name of your business in any of the following names we recommend to not install this plugin as it might be tracked:

* name of a plugin
* name of a controller action
* name of a report
* name of a widget
* name of an API method

Plugins that are installed via the Marketplace should not pose a problem as their names don\'t contain any user specific information such as the name of your business.

We track any information as efficient as possible to not slow down your Piwik. If you have already performance problems with your Piwik we recommend to not install this plugin though.

### Which data is tracked?

When the plugin is activated, the following data will be tracked:

* The pages and reports that are viewed
* The visitors\' software and devices data like the used browser and the resolution
* Some clicks or interactions with certain selectors or buttons. For example we track an event when a segment is selected but we do not track the actual segment.
* In a daily task we track the following data:
  * Piwik version
  * PHP version
  * Number of websites
  * Number of users
  * Number of segments
  * How often which API method was called (only plugin name and method name but no parameters) and how long the API calls took on average.

## FAQ

__Are there any prerequisites?__

* If sending usage data to Piwik is enabled, the Piwik installation must be connected to the internet
* If tracking to a custom Piwik installation is enabled, your Piwik installation and your Piwik users must be able to connect to this instance
* If tracking to a custom Piwik installation is enabled and your Piwik is served via HTTPS, the custom Piwik installation must be available via HTTPS as well

__Why was this plugin created?__

This plugin was created to provide a simple way to measure how Piwik product itself is being used. The opt-in and anonymised usage tracking information will be used by the Piwik creators to build a better product and a great user experience.

__Who has access to the tracked data at demo-anonymous.piwik.org?__

The data is public and therefore can be seen by anyone on [http://demo-anonymous.piwik.org](http://demo-anonymous.piwik.org).

This is to assure the tracked data is anonymous (transparency) and to showcase how Piwik can be used to track an application.

## Changelog

* 0.2.1 Track MySQL server version in a custom variable.
* 0.2.0 Add possibility to enable/disable anonymization and tracking user login as userID
* 0.1.4 Fixed a bug that failed to track under HTTPS under circumstances
* 0.1.3 Updated plugin description only
* 0.1.2 Bugfixes
* 0.1.1 Track average API executime time
* 0.1.0 Initial release

## Description

Modifies the \'API.get\' output to also list the website name and main website URL.

When calling the API method `API.get` it will be enriched with the following new fields for each website:

 * `idsite` - Website ID
 * `site_url` - Website URL
 * `site_name` - Website name

 If you specify `&idSite=all` it will decorate each website in the response with the new fields.
 
The output will look as follows:

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>
<result>
	<idsite>2</idsite>

## Description

This plugin allows you to measure the bandwidth that was used by each page view or download. 
It enriches existing reports and APIs to show the used bandwidth. Find more information in the FAQ.

## FAQ

__How can I track the bandwidth?__

Log analytics:

The bandwidth will be automatically tracked when using the [log importer](http://piwik.org/log-analytics/) as long as 
your log format is supported.

Tracking API:

If you are using the [HTTP Tracking API](http://developer.piwik.org/api-reference/tracking-api) 
you can specify the bandwidth in bytes by appending the URL parameter `bw_bytes=1234` to the tracking URL. In this case 
a bandwidth of 1234 bytes will be tracked.

__Which actions support tracking of bandwidth?__

Pageviews (Page URLs and Page Titles) as well as Downloads.

__In which reports is the used bandwidth displayed?__

* Page URLs 
* Page Titles
* Downloads

All reports will show a column `Average Bandwidth` and `Sum Bandwidth`

The "Visitors => Overview" report shows a total bandwidth overview and it is possible to view the evolution over period.

__Which APIs does this plugin define or enrich?__

There is a report `Bandwidth.get` returning the total bandwidth (across all actions).

It also enriches varies reports such as `Actions.get`, `Actions.getPageUrls`, `Actions.getPageTitles` and `Actions.getDownloads`.
For example it adds columns such as `avg_bandwidth`, `sum_bandwidth`, `min_bandwidth`, `max_bandwidth` to each page view.

__Why are the bandwidth columns are not displayed in the UI?__

Make sure the Bandwidth plugin is activated by going to `Administration => Plugins`. Also the bandwidth columns are not 
displayed if no bandwidth was tracked in the current selected month.

## Description

This is a plugin for the Open Source Web Analytics platform Piwik. If enabled, it will add a two new widgets that you can add to your dashboard.

The widgets will show a Visitor Barometer and a Visit Time Barometer that auto-refresh every 5 seconds. It shows the number of visitors or visit time in a N minute period compared to the maximum number of visitors/average visit time in any N minute period of the last 30 days.

The idea for this plugin came from [@muesli](http://github.com/muesli) who suggested it on #piwik in IRC.

## Documentation

1. Clone the plugin into the plugins directory of your Piwik installation.

   ```
   cd plugins/
   git clone https://github.com/halfdan/piwik-barometer-plugin.git Barometer
   ```

2. Login as superuser into your Piwik installation and activate the plugin under Settings -> Plugins

3. You will now find the widget under the Live! section.

<p>The widgets will show a Visitor Barometer and a Visit Time Barometer that auto-refresh every 5 seconds. It shows the number of visitors or visit time in a N minute period compared to the maximum number of visitors/average visit time in any N minute period of the last 30 days.</p>

<p>The idea for this plugin came from <a href="http://github.com/muesli">@muesli</a> who suggested it on #piwik in IRC.</p>

## Description

BotTracker ist a plugin to exclude and separately track the visits of bots, spiders and webcrawlers, that hit your page. Because Piwik doesn\'t store the user agent, BotTracker will only be able to track new bots from the moment you add them to its list forward (retroactive tracking isn\'t possible).

This plugin is still in BETA-status, but I have tested it for a while. It should be stable.

Before you install this plugin, here\'s something you should be aware of:
Many webcrawlers, spiders and bots don\'t load the images in a page and most of them don\'t execute JavaScript. So you cannot track them with Piwik if you don\'t use the PHP-API. The BotTracker can only track those that were caught by Piwik itself.

Additional info:
I wrote BotTracker for my own needs but people ask me to make it public - so I put it online.
It\'s free to use and I will support it as long as I can spend the time. But I will *not* activate a donation button. If someone is paying money, I feel like I have to support him. 
I want to work on this plugin because I want to and not because I have to. I hope you can unterstand that.

## How it works

The plugin scans the user agent of any incoming visit for specific keywords. If the keyword is found, the visit is excluded from the normal log and the corresponding counter in the bot-table (BOT_DB) is increased.
If you enable the "extra stats" for a bot entry, the visit will also be written into a second bot-table (BOT_DB_STAT). This second table logs the timestamp, the visited page and the user agent. The second table is currently not displayed in Piwik, but the more experienced users can select the data from the database. Some more detailed reports may come in the future.

You can add/delete/modify the keywords in the administration-menu. There are webpages that list the user-agents of known spiders and webcrawlers (e.g. http://www.useragentstring.com/pages/Crawlerlist/). The most common bots are already in the default list of the plugin.

<p>BotTracker ist a plugin to exclude and separately track the visits of bots, spiders and webcrawlers, that hit your page. Because Piwik doesn\'t store the user agent, BotTracker will only be able to track new bots from the moment you add them to its list forward (retroactive tracking isn\'t possible).</p>

<p>This plugin is still in BETA-status, but I have tested it for a while. It should be stable.</p>

<p>Before you install this plugin, here\'s something you should be aware of:
Many webcrawlers, spiders and bots don\'t load the images in a page and most of them don\'t execute JavaScript. So you cannot track them with Piwik if you don\'t use the PHP-API. The BotTracker can only track those that were caught by Piwik itself.</p>

<p>Additional info:
I wrote BotTracker for my own needs but people ask me to make it public - so I put it online.
It\'s free to use and I will support it as long as I can spend the time. But I will <em>not</em> activate a donation button. If someone is paying money, I feel like I have to support him. 
I want to work on this plugin because I want to and not because I have to. I hope you can unterstand that.</p>

## Description

This plugin will clear out the tmp dir of Piwik. Useful for when you are developing other plugins or just need to kill that file and can\'t get to your installation to delete it normally

## Changelog
~2015~

2015-03-24 - Updated all language files to ensure they are UTF-8 encoded and updated German text (Thanks to rauolive @ https://github.com/rauolive)

2015-03-12 - Updated because I left out the call to Piwik::hasUserSuperUserAccess(). Also added translations because why not. If they are not accurate, please let me know what I should use as these came straight from google translate.

2015-03-12 - Updated to work with the latest menu calls. Thanks to mnapoli for pointing out the issue


~2014~

2014-04-29 - Thanks to Thomas-Piwik at (http://forum.piwik.org/read.php?9,114223,114638#msg-114638), we now have a nice message that let\'s us know that the cache has been cleared. Also, per that same thread, updated the delete code to use Filesystem::unlinkRecursive instead of native delete commands. 

2014-04-19 - Updated to work with 2.2.0. Removed the custom directory separator code and switch to use the PHP constant.

2014-02-21 - Update some more code, added in notification area but it\'s not quite working yet (TODO - make it work)

2014-02-21 - Rebranded to cacheBuster and set version to 1.0, updated code to use a better check for directory seperator

2014-02-20 - v2.0 - Updated plugin to work with Piwik 2.0.3

~2013~

Inital creation of plugin at http://www.spherexx.com under the name ClearCache

This plugin is not production ready, but any help is appreciate!

Engage people you don\'t know at all, with this targeted and efficient chat system, directly integrated into Piwik.

The client has these three states, plus a minimized state :

![Chat Client](/screenshots/ClientState2.png?raw=true "Chat Client State 2")
![Chat Client](/screenshots/ClientState3.png?raw=true "Chat Client State 3")
![Chat Client](/screenshots/ClientState4.png?raw=true "Chat Client State 4")

And here is the updated Visitor Profile :
![Backend](/screenshots/BackendVisitorProfile.png?raw=true "Visitor Profile in Backend")

## Installation
Add this code, after Piwik\'s tracking code :

    <!-- Piwik Chat -->
    <script type="text/javascript">
        (function() {
            var u=(("https:" == document.location.protocol) ? "https://{$PIWIK_URL}/" : "http://{$PIWIK_URL}/");
            var d=document, g=d.createElement(\'script\'), s=d.getElementsByTagName(\'script\')[0]; g.type=\'text/javascript\';
            g.defer=true; g.async=true; g.src=u+\'plugins/Chat/javascripts/client/client.js\'; s.parentNode.insertBefore(g,s);
        })();
    </script>
    <!-- End Piwik Chat Code -->

## How it works
On the backend, this plugin modifies the visitorProfile popup, by adding to it a "Chat" tab next to "Visited pages". A new menu "Chat" is available, which allows to browse all conversations.

Soon, a reporting system will be integrated, which will show figures like conversion rate or engagement, in function of the Chat\'s use.

After installing the plugin, you have to modify your tracking code. It includes the file "javascripts/client/client.js", which waits for the Tracker() to initialize, then appends an iframe to the page. This iframe requests the "popout" action of the controller, where the plugin tries to identify the visitor based on his visitorID or configID.

## Academical study
As an MSc student in eBusiness, this project is part of my final dissertation : "How to engage people you don\'t know at all ?".

The first part of this project is to develop the module and its reporting system. Then, the second part will be about analyse the impact of this Chat system (conversion rate, engagement, etc..) in function of its use, and eventually try to determine which way of use is the most efficient. From this research it may be possible to provide advices and answer questions like : What is the best behavior to adopt as an operator? What kinds of automatic messages are the more efficient in order to increase conversion?

To lead this study, I will need data! And if you support my work, you\'ll be able to send me your reports via the plugin, in an anonymized way.',

## Description
ClickHeat is a visual heatmap of clicks on a HTML page, showing hot and cold click zones. This plugin based on [Dugwood\'s ClickHeat version 1.14](https://github.com/dugwood/clickheat). It is an OpenSource software, released under GPL licence, and free of charge. 

__Plugin not consider the IIS.__ Sorry. We are waiting patches for IIS.

## Installation
Install it via Piwik Marketplace.

This plugin installer will make directories:
* yourpiwik/tmp/cache/clickheat/cache
* yourpiwik/tmp/cache/clickheat/logs.

This plugin uses a different tracker. Please click on the link "JavaScript" and put the special Javascript codes into your website.

## FAQ
__What exactly is included in this feature ?__

* pick up a siteid
* pick up a period
* pick up a browser type
* pick up a specific web page

__And what functions are not included in this feature ?__

* remove special addresses defined on the control panel.
* remove special browsers defined on the control panel.
* filters based on added segmentation

__Where is the coordinate information from the browser ?__

ClickHeat plugin uses text files to record the coordinate data of each browser in directory: yourpiwik/tmp/cache/clickheat/logs.

__What is "click.php returned a status code 403" ?__

You have to perform the upgrade immediately to version 0.1.5. I forgot to put .htaccess.

__After installing the plugin, Piwik Administration area shows "page not found 404 error".__

This plugin doesn\'t consider the IIS. Sorry. And please delete the ClickHeat plugin (yourpiwik/plugins/ClickHeat) manually via FTP or Explorer. We are waiting patches for IIS.

__Does it withstands high traffics ?__

This plugin uses minimal text to record data and file based logging. And when click.php is called from a special Javascript for cgi, just append text on end of the each file. And when you analyze the click data and make a heatmap, plugin will create cached heatmap as png image file. 

Therefore, we expect the plugin light works, but we don\'t know what load it has under Piwik 2.x. So we are very glad, when you inform us about your situation. 

Please see the link [Performance and optimization](http://www.labsmedia.com/clickheat/156894.html) about system resources. If you want performance, you need to avoid to use a cgi, that is possible. It method is explained on the link. 

__New click data were added, but not updated heatmap. Why ?__

Plugin places heatmap images in the cache directory: yourpiwik/tmp/cache/clickheat/cache. Therefore when you suddenly met with such probrem, you can delete cache files, but __do not delete cache directory__.

__Showed a heatmap, but not overlay a heatmap to the target web page. Why ?__

Check that your website does not set the HTTP header __X-FRAME-OPTIONS__ to __SAMEORIGIN__ as this will prevent this plugin from iframing your website for the heatmap report. Please see [Page Overlay Troubleshooting](http://piwik.org/docs/page-overlay/#page-overlay-troubleshooting), that is same problem.

## Changelog

* 0.1.0 First beta
* 0.1.2 to append faq
* 0.1.3 to append faq
* 0.1.5 to add .htaccess

## License

## Description

Create Custom Alerts + Be notified by email/SMS!

Alerts are a great way to get notified of changes on your website. Want to know if your new product hits less than 100 sales in a week or your new article attracts more than 200 visitors a day? Create alerts that make sense to you. Be notified by email or SMS when the conditions for your alerts are met. Stay on top of your website!

The Alert log will help you to better understand the success of your website. You can use it to analyze how often your website hit more than 10000 visits per day or on how many days a product was sold more than 50 times.

This plugin was [crowdfunded with the support](http://crowdfunding.piwik.org/custom-alerts-plugin/) of 37 Piwik community members!

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/piwik/plugin-CustomDimensions.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/piwik/plugin-CustomDimensions)

## Description

This plugins allows you to configure and track any [Custom Dimensions](https://piwik.org/docs/custom-dimensions/). You can configure a Custom Dimension
by giving it a name and a scope (Action or Visit). Afterwards you will see a new menu item in the reporting area
for each configured dimension and be able to get its data. You can also export the report as a widget, segment by this
 dimenson, and more. For more information read the [Custom Dimensions user guide](https://piwik.org/docs/custom-dimensions/) or have a look in the FAQ.

*Warning*: Depending on the database size of your Piwik this plugin may take a long time to install.

## FAQ

__I have a large database, can I install the plugin on the command line?__

Yes, this is not only possible but even recommended as the installation may take hours. To do this follow these steps:

* Download the Plugin from [https://plugins.piwik.org/CustomDimensions](https://plugins.piwik.org/CustomDimensions)
* Extract the files within the downloaded ZIP file
* Copy the `CustomDimensions` directory into the `plugins` directory of your Piwik
* Execute the command `./console plugin:activate CustomDimensions` within your Piwik directory

__Where can I manage Custom Dimensions?__

Custom Dimensions can be managed by clicking on your username or user icon in the top right. There will be a menu
item "Custom Dimensions" within the "Manage" section of the left menu. By clicking on it you can manage Custom Dimensions.
Please note that the permission Admin is required in order to be able to manage them.

__Where can I find the Id for a Custom Dimension?__

You can find them by going to the "Manage Custom Dimensions" page in your personal area. For each dimension you will
find the Id in the table that lists all available Custom Dimensions.

__How do I set a value for a dimension in the JavaScript Tracker?__

Please have a look at the [JavaScript Tracker guide for Custom Dimensions](https://developer.piwik.org/guides/tracking-javascript-guide#custom-dimensions).

__How do I set a value for a dimension in the PHP Tracker?__

`$tracker->setCustomTrackingParameter(\'dimension\' . $customDimensionId, $value);`

Please note custom tracking parameters are cleared after each tracking request. If you want to keep the same
Custom Dimensions over all request make sure to call this method before each tracking call.

__I have configured all available Custom Dimension slots, can I add more?__

Yes, this is possible. To make a new Custom Dimension slot available execute the following command including the scope option:

```
./console customdimensions:add-custom-dimension --scope=action
./console customdimensions:add-custom-dimension --scope=visit
```

Be aware that this can take a long time depending on the size of your database as it requires MySQL schema changes.
You can directly create multiple Custom Dimension slots. To do this add the option `--count=X`. Usually it doesn\'t take much
longer to create directly multiple new slots.

__Is it possible to delete a Custom Dimension and all of its data?__

In the UI it is only possible to deactivate a dimension. However, on the command line you can remove a Custom Dimension
and report it\'s log data by executing the following console command:

```
./console customdimensions:remove-custom-dimension --scope=$scope --index=$index
```

Make sure to replace `$scope` and `$index` with the correct values. To get a list of all available indexes execute `./console customdimensions:info`.

Removing a Custom Dimension may take a long time as it requires MySQL schema changes. Currently, only log data is removed. Archived reports will be
not deleted currently.

## Changelog

## Description

Adds a new admin tab allowing to change the opt-out CSS Styles for each website.

## Usage

1) Click on the "Settings" link located in the top menu on the right

2) Click on the "Custom Opt-Out" tab located in the "Settings" section of the sidebar on the left

3) Enter your customized CSS code into the textarea input field called "Custom Css" e.g.
```css     
  body {
    font-family: Arial, Verdana, sans-serif;
    font-size: 12px;
    color: #ddd;
    line-height: 160%;
    margin: 10px;
    padding: 0;
  }
```
or insert a URL to the file containing your custom CSS into the input field called "External CSS File" e.g.

  ``http://www.example.org/styles/piwikcustom.css``

4) Click the "Save" button.

5) Use the iframe code provided below the input fields to add the Piwiki Opt-Out to your website.

## How to change the opt-out text

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/PiwikPRO/plugin-CustomTrackerJs.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/PiwikPRO/plugin-CustomTrackerJs)

## Description

The `CustomTrackerJs` plugin lets the super users or other plugins add custom code to the Piwik Javascript Tracker.

## Usage

### Super users

Super users can set the Javascript code they want to add to the `piwik.js` file in `Settings > Plugin settings`.

Any code added in the *Javascript code* textbox will be appended to `piwik.js` by a scheduled task. Be very careful
as to write valid Javascript code since invalid code can break the tracker.

### Other plugins

Plugins can make use of the `CustomTrackerJs.getTrackerJsAdditions` event to register Javascript code to add to
the tracker.

For example this will add a `console.log("Hello world!");` line to the tracker:

```php
class MyPlugin extends \\Piwik\\Plugin
{
    public function getListHooksRegistered()
    {
        return array(
            \'CustomTrackerJs.getTrackerJsAdditions\' => \'getTrackerJsAdditions\',
        );
    }

    public function getTrackerJsAdditions(&$code)
    {
        $code .= PHP_EOL . \'console.log("Hello world!");\';
    }
}
```

## Description

This plugin allows the Piwik users to dynamically exclude their IP address using DDNS update.

### Requirements

[Piwik](https://github.com/piwik/piwik) 2.4.0 or higher is required.

### Features

- Exclude one IP for each Piwik user 
- Exclude and IP using an already updated hostname

## FAQ

__Which update method should i use, _DDNS Update_ or _DDNS Hostname_?__

If available, ___DDNS Update___ is recommended. This method is a bit more complicated to set up, but it leads to immediately updated IP\'s, as the client will trigger the update whenever a new IP is assigned.
But it may not be viable for all users, eg. 
* Not all DDNS clients allow custom update-URL\'s.
* The client may be already serving another Server and have no ability to talk to multiple Servers at the same time.

So, the ___DDNS Hostname___ can be an alternative. Use a DDNS Service that is compatible with your client and enter the hostname from there to have the plugin resolve your dynamic IP. The downside: Updating happens via a sheduled task every hour, so there might be small windows with the new IP still being tracked, but not the old one.

__What data do I need to set for DDNS Update__

You need to set a custom URL to be triggered for an update.
Your personal update-URL is shown in your piwik installation (user-menu > Personal > DDNS Settings).

The URL has the following scheme:
```
http{s}://{piwik.url}/index.php?module=ExcludeByDDNS&action=update&token_auth={token_auth}
```

- {s} Use HTTPS if available.
- {piwik.url}: The URL to your piwik installation.
- {token_auth}: Your API auth token (user-menu > Platform > API).

There is no need to set user, password or domain name.

## Description

This plugin allows you to include a small image or iframe in you website displaying the flags and total hits of the countries your website visitors came from

Please keep in mind that everyone will be able to see that kind of statistic as this plugin does not consider the access rights.

### Requirements

[Piwik](https://github.com/piwik/piwik) 2.0.4 or higher is required.
GD library including ttf support

### Features

- Configurable with following parameters:
  - idSite: Website to display
  - period: period to display
  - date: date to display
  - cols: count of columns to display (default 2)
  - rows: count of rows to display (default 5)
  - showflag: show flags (default 1)
  - showcountryode: show country codes (default 0)
  - font: font family to use
  - fontsize: font size to use (between 2 and 30; default 12)
  - fontcolor: font color to use (rgb value; default 0,0,0)
- Generates a transparent PNG image showing the flag icons and their total hits
- Generates simple HTML to be included as iframe

## FAQ

__The image is not displayed. What can I do?__

Maybe you have some kind of access restriction for your Piwik like http auth. The Url needs to be public accessible, or at least accessible to those, who should be able to see the counter.

__How can I display the counter for all data in the past__

To do that, set period to ```range``` and date to something like ```1992-01-01,today```.

The full URL for the image would then look like:
```
http://piwik.url/index.php?module=FlagCounter&action=image&idSite=1&period=range&date=1992-01-01,today&cols=2&rows=6
``` 

__Can I use a custom font?__

Currently all ttf fonts located in the ```fonts``` directory within this plugin are available for usage. If you place a new font there, you should be able to use it.


## Changelog

- Version 0.1 - Alpha Release
- Version 0.2 
  - improved image generation (automatic spacing between items)
  - possibility to show country codes besides or instead of the flags
- Version 0.3
  - added ability to choose a font family, size & color

## Description

### Features

- Userbased activation of Google Authenticator 2FA

## Changelog

- 0.1.0 Added possibility to define title and description for Google Authenticator app

**Analyze how visitors navigate between your websites.**

## Description

Measures number of visits and unique visitors that have navigated across two or three specific websites.

_(Unique user is determined across websites using the fingerprint config\\_id stored in the DB.)_

## Features

### See how many visitors visited more than one of your websites.

To access this functionality, navigate to the All Websites dashboard. Here there will be a new link that says _Number of visitors who viewed several websites_. Click this link and a dialog will display that will allow you to get visitor metrics for many sites.

Comparison of visits is done in dates for the UTC time, not for the site specific time.

## Description

Piwik plugin to locate all locale data of a user based on the IP address/subnetwork (country, region, city, latitude, longitude, provider, ...)

***Please use it only for INTRANET tracking*** everything else just dont make sense :-)

## FAQ

__What does this plugin do?__

It adds visitor information based on the matched IP address from your configuration. Not more and not less.
The database schema and UI stays untouched, so all Piwik statistics can be used like you would use a internet GeoIP database.


__How to configure/install this plugin / the networks?__

After installation and activation of the plugin, open the file `piwik/config/IntranetGeoIP.data.php`

You can their add your location information and their subnetworks.

See the file `piwik/config/IntranetGeoIP.data.php` or see the readme on github https://github.com/ThaDafinser/IntranetGeoIp


__What statistics are available?__

If you create a full configuration data file, you\'ll see
* Visitor -> Realtime visitor map
* Visitor -> Location and provider
* and many more...(in generall all statistics are available like using a internet GeoIP database)


__Why there stands provider "unknown" in my visitor log?__

If your installation is stock, all visitors will get this "flag" to show you, what IPs are not matched.
You can adjust or remove this, by changing the "noMatch" block in your `IntranetGeoIP.data.php` file.
If you remove the complete block, none matched visitors will be skipped by this plugin.
But you can also fill all possible visitorInfos like you are used for matched IP addresses.


__Can i use this plugin with a internet GeoIP database side by side?__

Yes you can.
Just remove or comment out the `noMatch` block in your configuration file.

__Note about the configuration?__

Inside the array key `visitorInfo` you can freely add/remove all available columns from the `log_visit` table you want.
The keys below are just a suggestion, since they are the only one which make sense currently IMO.
All available fields, see here: http://developer.piwik.org/guides/persistence-and-the-mysql-backend#visits

Inside they key `networks` add all subnetworks which apply to this location.

```php
return [
    /*
     * If the IP was not matched, apply these data to visitorInfo
     * You can also apply here all possible visitorInformation data if you want
     */
    \'noMatch\' => [
        \'visitorInfo\' => [

## Description

This plugin (try) to get the hostname of the visitor and write it into the `log_visitor` table.

There are currently ***no reports or any views available***, to see a result. ***You need to directly query the table!***
I currently dont have the time and need of such a view, and therefor maybe you\'ll never see one...if nobody else create oen :-)

NOTE:
***I use it currently only in an intranet enviroment*** to detect computers which have old enviroment, because the IP might change i log the hostname.

I never tried it and probably wont use it for internet...

## Description

This is a plugin for Piwik that generates reports about the IPv6 reach of your websites. It is written as a tracker plugin and directly hooks into the Piwik tracking call.

## Documentation

I wrote an article about the development that lead to this plugin and explained how the plugin works internally. You can find the article at [Geekmonkey](http://geekmonkey.org/articles/34-how-to-write-a-piwik-plugin)

There is also a [short article](http://geekmonkey.org/articles/33-tracking-the-ipv6-reach-of-your-website-with-piwik/) that explains how to setup the plugin.

## Description

Configurable piwik plugin to create an LDAP connection, which can be reused by other plugins.
Is uses the ZF2 Ldap component: http://framework.zend.com/manual/2.3/en/index.html#zend-ldap

Currently used by https://github.com/ThaDafinser/LdapVisitorInfo

## FAQ

__Why is PIWIK 2.5 required?__

Because the configuration (to be explicit accountFilterFormat) is destroyed in the previous version
See the ticket here: https://github.com/piwik/piwik/issues/5890


__What does this plugin do?__

It creates based on your configuration a connection to LDAP. Not more and not less :-)


__How can i use this LDAP connection in another plugin?__

This is an example to retrieve the connection.
For documentation please see http://framework.zend.com/manual/2.3/en/index.html#zend-ldap

```php
namespace Piwik\\Plugins\\YourPlugin;

use Piwik\\Plugin;
use Piwik\\Plugins\\LdapConnection\\API as APILdapConnection;
use Zend\\Ldap\\Ldap;

class YourPlugin extends Plugin
{
    private function doSomething()
    {
    	/* @var $ldap \\Zend\\Ldap\\Ldap */
        $ldap = APILdapConnection::getInstance()->getConnection();
        $ldap->connect();
        
        $filter = sprintf(\'(&(objectclass=user)(samAccountName=%s))\', $visitorUsername);
        $collection = $ldap->search($filter, null, Ldap::SEARCH_SCOPE_SUB, [\'displayname\']);
        
        if ($collection->count() >= 1) {
        	$result = $collection->getFirst();
        	//do something with the result...
        }
    }
}

<p>It creates based on your configuration a connection to LDAP. Not more and not less :-)</p>

<p><strong>How can i use this LDAP connection in another plugin?</strong></p>

<p>This is an example to retrieve the connection.
For documentation please see http://framework.zend.com/manual/2.3/en/index.html#zend-ldap</p>

<pre><code>namespace Piwik\\Plugins\\YourPlugin;

use Piwik\\Plugin;
use Piwik\\Plugins\\LdapConnection\\API as APILdapConnection;
use Zend\\Ldap\\Ldap;

class YourPlugin extends Plugin
{
    private function doSomething()
    {
        /* @var $ldap \\Zend\\Ldap\\Ldap */
        $ldap = APILdapConnection::getInstance()-&gt;getConnection();
        $ldap-&gt;connect();

        $filter = sprintf(\'(&amp;(objectclass=user)(samAccountName=%s))\', $visitorUsername);
        $collection = $ldap-&gt;search($filter, null, Ldap::SEARCH_SCOPE_SUB, [\'displayname\']);

        if ($collection-&gt;count() &gt;= 1) {
            $result = $collection-&gt;getFirst();
            //do something with the result...
        }
    }
}

## Description

Configurable piwik plugin to view a visitor thumbnail and description live from LDAP.

***This plugin requires https://github.com/ThaDafinser/LdapConnection to work!***

## FAQ

__Why is PIWIK 2.5 required?__

Because the configuration (to be explicit accountFilterFormat) is destroyed in the previous version
See the ticket here: https://github.com/piwik/piwik/issues/5890


__What does this plugin do?__

It displays live a thumbnail and a description in the visitor detail page from LDAP


__How to tell Piwik which user is currently using your website?__

You need so track a custom user (username, mail, ...) visitor variable, so this plugin know which user shall be fetched from LDAP.
Please see the official documentation: http://piwik.org/docs/custom-variables/ or http://developer.piwik.org/api-reference/tracking-javascript#custom-variables

Example:
`_paq.push(["setCustomVariable", 1, "username", "<?php echo $usenamer; ?>", "visit"]);`

__NEW: Use the userId from Piwik itself__

Now you can use the piwik UserId: http://piwik.org/docs/user-id/
Just change the plugin settings to use the piwik UserId instead of a custom variable!

## Description

This is a plugin for the Open Source Web Analytics platform [Piwik](http://piwik.org). It allows you to keep an eye on the number of live visitors in the browser tab. It displays the number of visits, actions, unique visitors or converted goals in the last X minutes in the browser tab. The number will be updated every minute.

For better and faster readability the value will be shortened when greater than 1000. For instance to 3.12K or 3.43M.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/piwik/plugin-LoginHttpAuth.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/piwik/plugin-LoginHttpAuth)

## Description

This plugin extends the standard Piwik authentication to use Basic HTTP Authentication.
It lets you login to Piwik using the HTTP Auth mechanism.

How do I setup HTTP Auth using Piwik?

* Login your Piwik as Super User. Click Settings, then click Marketplace.
* Install the LoginHttpAuth plugin, then click Activate.
* Click Settings, then click Users.
    * Check that there is a user in Piwik for each person that should have access to Piwik.
* Enable HTTP Auth on the Piwik on your web server.

    For example, if you are using Apache webserver:

    * generate a .htpasswd file with your encrypted logins and passwords
    * [copy this example .htaccess file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/piwik/plugin-LoginHttpAuth/master/TemplateHtaccess/.htaccess) in the root directory of Piwik, and set the path to your .htpasswd file
* When you go to Piwik, you will see the Authentication window.
  Congratulations! You are now using HTTP Auth to protect Piwik.

## Changelog

 * 1.0.3 - Fixing regression w/ Piwik 2.15: authenticating by token auth or by username/password (w/o an HTTP server) failed.
 * 1.0 - First public release [compatible with Piwik 2](http://piwik.org/blog/2013/12/piwik-2-0-release-announced-biggest-best-release-yet/)

## Description

**Piwik authentication module that allows users in LDAP to log in to Piwik. Supports web server authentication (eg, for Kerberos SSO).**

LoginLdap authenticates with an LDAP server and uses LDAP information to personalize Piwik.

## Installation

To start using LoginLdap, follow these steps:

1. Login as a superuser
2. On the _Manager > Plugins_ admin page, enable the LoginLdap plugin
3. Navigate to the _Settings > LDAP_ page
4. Enter and save settings for your LDAP servers

   _Note: You can test your servers by entering something into the \'Required User Group\' and clicking the test link that appears.
   An error message will display if LoginLdap cannot connect to the LDAP server._

5. You can now login with LDAP cedentials.

_**Note:** LDAP users are not synchronized with Piwik until they are first logged in. This means you cannot access a token auth for an LDAP user until the user is synchronized.
If you use the default LoginLdap configuration, you can synchronize all of your LDAP users at once using the `./console loginldap:synchronize-users` command._

## Troubleshooting

To troubleshoot any connectivity issues, read our [troubleshooting guide](https://github.com/piwik/plugin-LoginLdap/wiki/Troubleshooting).

## Upgrading from 2.2.7

Version 3.0.0 is a major rewrite of the plugin, so if you are upgrading for 2.2.7 you will have to do some extra work when upgrading:

- Navigate tothe _Settings > LDAP_ admin page. If the configuration options look broken, make sure to reload your browser cache. You can do this by reloading the page, or through your browser\'s settings.

- The admin user for servers must now be a full DN. In the LDAP settings page, change the admin name to be the full DN (ie, cn=...,dc=...).

- Uncheck the `Use LDAP for authentication` checkbox

  Version 2.2.7 and below used an authentication strategy where user passwords were stored both in Piwik and in LDAP. In order to keep your current
  users\' token auths from changing, that same strategy has to be used.

## Configurations

LoginLdap supports three different LDAP authentication strategies:

- using LDAP for authentication only
- using LDAP for synchronization only
- logging in with Kerberos SSO (or something similar)

Each strategy has advantages and disadvantages. What you should use depends on your needs.

### Using LDAP for authentication only

This strategy is more secure than the one below, but it requires connecting to the LDAP server on each login attempt.

With this strategy, every time a user logs in, LoginLdap will connect to LDAP to authenticate. On successful login, the user can
be synchronised, but the user\'s password is never stored in Piwik\'s DB, just in the LDAP server. Additionally, the token auth is generated using
a hash of a hash of the password, or is generated randomly.

This means that if the Piwik DB is ever compromised, your LDAP users\' passwords will still be safe.

_Note: With this auth strategy, non-LDAP users are still allowed to login to Piwik. These users must be created through Piwik, not in LDAP._

**Steps to enable**

_Note: this is the default configuration._

1. Check the `Use LDAP for authentication` option and uncheck the `Use Web Server Auth (e.g. Kerberos SSO)` option.

### Using LDAP for synchronization only

This strategy involves storing the user\'s passwords in the Piwik DB using Piwik\'s hashing. As a result, it is not as secure as the above
method. If your Piwik DB is compromised, your LDAP users\' passwords will be in greater danger of being cracked.

But, this strategy opens up the possibility of not communicating with LDAP servers at all during authentication, which may provide a better user experience.

_Note: With this auth strategy, non-LDAP users can login to Piwik._

**Steps to enable**

1. Uncheck the `Use LDAP for authentication` option and uncheck the `Use Web Server Auth (e.g. Kerberos SSO)` option.
2. If you don\'t want to connect to LDAP while logging in, uncheck the `Synchronize Users After Successful Login` option.
   
   a. If you uncheck this option, make sure your users are synchronized in some other way (eg, by using the `loginldap:synchronize-users` command).
      Piwik still needs information about your LDAP users in order to let them authenticate.

### Logging in with Kerberos SSO (or something similar)

This strategy delegates authentication to the webserver. You setup a system where the webserver authenticates the user and
sets the `$_SERVER[\'REMOTE_USER\']` server variable, and LoginLdap will assume the user is already authenticated.

This strategy will still connect to an LDAP server in order to synchronize user information, unless configured not to.

_Note: With this auth strategy, any user that appears as a REMOTE_USER can login, even if they are not in LDAP._

**Steps to enable**

1. Check the `Use Web Server Auth (e.g. Kerberos SSO)` option.
2. If you don\'t want to connect to LDAP while logging in, uncheck the `Synchronize Users After Successful Login` option.
   
   a. If you uncheck this option, make sure your users are synchronized in some other way (eg, by using the `loginldap:synchronize-users` command).
      Piwik still needs information about your LDAP users in order to let them authenticate.

## Features

### Authenticating with Kerberos

If you want to use Kerberos, check the **Use Web Server Auth (e.g. Kerberos SSO)** checkbox in the LDAP settings admin page.

Then, make sure your web server performs the necessary authentication and sets the `$_SERVER[\'REMOTE_USER\']` server variable when a user is authenticated.

When the `$_SERVER[\'REMOTE_USER\']` variable is set, LoginLdap will assume the user has already been authenticated.

_Note: The plugin will still communicate with the LDAP server in order to synchronize user details, so if LDAP settings are incorrect, authentication will fail._

### Specifying Fallback Servers

LoginLdap v3.0.0 and greater supports specifying multiple LDAP servers to use. If connecting to one server fails, the other servers are used as fallbacks.

You can enter fallback servers by adding new servers at the bottom of the _Settings > LDAP_ page.

### Filtering Users in LDAP

You can use the **Required User Group** and **LDAP Search Filter** settings to filter LDAP entries. Users whose entries do not match these filters
will not be allowed to authenticate.

Set **Required User Group** to the full DN of a group the user should be a member of. _Note: Internally, LoginLdap will issue a query using `(memberof=?)`
to find users of a certain group. Your server may require additional configuration to support `memberof`._

Set **LDAP Search Filter** to an LDAP filter string to use, for example: `(objectClass=person)` or
`(&(resMemberOf=cn=mygroup,ou=commonOU,dc=www,dc=example,dc=org)(objectclass=person))`.

You can test both of these settings from within the LDAP settings page.

### LDAP User Synchronization

LoginLdap will use information in LDAP to determine a user\'s alias and email address. On the _Settings > LDAP_ page, you can specify which LDAP attributes should be
use to determine these fields.

_Note: If the LDAP attribute for a user\'s alias is not found, the user\'s alias is defaulted to the first and last names of the user. On the settings page you can
specify which LDAP attributes are used to determine a user\'s first & last name._

**E-mail addresses**

E-mail addresses are required for Piwik users. If your users in LDAP do not have e-mail addresses, you can set the **E-mail Address Suffix** setting to an e-mail
address suffix, for example:

`@myorganization.com`

The suffix will be added to usernames to generate an e-mail address for your users.

Users are synchronized every time they log in. You can use the `loginldap:synchronize-users` command to synchronize users manually.

### Piwik Access Synchronization

LoginLdap also supports synchronizing access levels using attributes found in LDAP. To use this feature, first, you will need to modify your LDAP server\'s
schema and add three special attributes to user entries:

- an attribute to specify the sites a user has view access to
- an attribute to specify the sites a user has admin access to
- and an attribute used to specify if a user is a superuser or not

_Note: You can choose whatever names you want for these attributes. You will be able to tell LoginLdap about these names in the LDAP settings page._

Then you must set these attributes correctly within LDAP, for example:

- `view: all`
- `admin: 1,2,3`
- `superuser: 1`

Finally, in the LDAP settings page, check the **Enable User Access Synchronization from LDAP** checkbox and fill out the settings that appear below it.

User access synchronization occurs at the same time as normal user synchronization. So the `loginldap:synchronize-users` command will synchronize access levels too.

#### Managing Access for Multiple Piwik Instances

LoginLdap supports using a single LDAP server to manage access for multiple Piwik instances. If you\'d like to use this feature, you must specify special values
for LDAP access attributes. For example:

- `view: mypiwikserver.whatever.com:1,2,3;myotherserver.com:all`
- `admin: mypiwikserver.whatever.com:all;mythirdserver.com:3,4`
- `superuser: myotherserver.com;myotherserver.com/otherpiwik`

If you don\'t want to use URLs in your access attributes, you can use the **Special Name For This Piwik Instance** setting to specify a special name
for each of your Piwiks. For example, if you set it to \'piwikServerA\' in one Piwik and \'piwikServerB\' in another, your LDAP attributes might look
like:

- `view: piwikServerA:1,2,3;piwikServerB:all`
- `admin: piwikServerA:4,5,6`
- `superuser: piwikServerC`

**Using a custom access attribute format**

You can customize the separators used in access attributes by setting the **User Access Attribute Server Specification Delimiter** and
**User Access Attribute Server & Site List Separator** settings.

If you set the **User Access Attribute Server Specification Delimiter** option to `\'#\'`, access attributes can be specified as:

`view: piwikServerA:1,2,3#piwikServerB:all`

If you set the **User Access Attribute Server & Site List Separator** option to `\'#\'`, access attributes can be specified as:

`view: piwikServerA#1,2,3;piwikServerB#all`

## Security Considerations

**User passwords**

For added security, LoginLdap\'s default configuration will not store user passwords or a hash of a user password within Piwik\'s DB. So if the Piwik DB is compromised
for whatever reason, user passwords will not be compromised.

**Token Auths**

LDAP has no concept of authentication tokens, so user token_auths are stored exclusively in Piwik\'s MySQL DB. If a token auth is compromised,
you can have Piwik generate a new one by changing a user\'s password in LDAP.

If you\'ve enabled the `Generate Random token_auth For New Users` option and a token auth is compromised, you\'ll have to run the
`loginldap:generate-token-auth` command to generate a new one.

**Logging**

LoginLdap uses debug logging extensively so problems can be diagnosed quickly. The logs should not contain sensitive information, but _you
should still disable DEBUG logging in production_.

If you need to debug a problem, enable it temporarily by changing the `[log] log_level` and `[log] log_writers` core INI config options.
If you use file logs, make sure to delete the logs after you are finished debugging.

## Commands

LoginLdap comes with the following console commands:

* `loginldap:generate-token-auth`: Regenerates a token auth for a user if the `Generate Random token_auth For New Users` option is currently
  enabled.

* `loginldap:synchronize-users`: Can be used to synchronize one, multiple, or all users in LDAP at once. If you\'d like to setup user access
  within Piwik before a user logs in, this command should be used.

## Description

View log messages that were logged by Piwik via the Piwik UI or HTTP Reporting API.

## FAQ

__I want to see more than 100 log messages, is it possible?__

Yes, there is a `limit` URL parameter that you can change to any number.

__Can I use regular expressions in the search field?__

Yes, you can enable regular expressions next to the search field.

__Is the search field case insensitive?__

Yes.

__How is a Piwik log line formatted by default?__

`\'$severity $tag[$datetime] [$requestId] $message` eg `WARNING Piwik\\Common[2015-01-01 01:02:03] [cf27] The log message`

__Is the search pattern applied to the whole log line?__

Yes, this means a search for `WARNING Piwik\\Common` would deliver you all warnings triggered by `Piwik\\Common`.

__How do I find all messages that belong to a certain request?__

Each log message shows a "Request Id". By clicking on this Id it selects all log messages of the same request.
Alternatively you can search for the expression `\\[1234\\]` where `1234` need to be replaced by a Request Id.

__How do I find messages that belong to the same day?__

Either click on a date field or search for it, eg `2012-12-12`.

__What are the known issues?__

* If there are messages being logged while viewing the log messages, the paging might not work 100% correctly.
* There seems to be a problem when searching for a single quotation mark "\'".

## Changelog

* 0.2.0 Compatibility w/ Piwik 2.15.
* 0.1.1 Fix for IE8
* 0.1.0 Initial Release

## Description

This is a plugin for the Open Source Web Analytics platform Piwik. If enabled, it will add a new widget that you can add to your dashboard and a new link in the top navigation.

The widget will show the performance index of a site that auto-refreshes every 30 seconds. It shows the number of visitors or visit time in a 30 minute period compared to the maximum number of visitors in any 30 minute period of the last 30 days.

This plugin is inspired by the [piwik barometer plugin](https://github.com/halfdan/piwik-barometer-plugin) and uses a lightly modified jQuery-Dynameter (original by [Tzechiu Lei](http://tze1.com/dynameter/).

**This plugin should run fine with installations with up to 100.000 page impressions per day. If you run a very large piwik installation and have performance issues with this plugin, please contact me - there is a solution for this. I have it up and running in an installation with more than 5 million visits per day.**

(Tested with piwik 2.7.0, but supposed to run with older versions)

## Installation

Install it via Piwik Marketplace OR install manually:

1. Clone the plugin into the plugins directory of your Piwik installation.

   ```
   cd plugins/
   git clone https://github.com/chanzler/piwik-performance-monitor.git PerformanceMonitor
   ```

2. Login as superuser into your Piwik installation and activate the plugin under Settings -> Plugins

3. You will now find the widget under the Live! section.

4. When you update: As there have been made several changes in v0.2.0 you might have to clear your cache (console core:clear-caches) 

## FAQ

###Features
Here is a list of features that are included in this project:

* Live widget ("Performance Monitor") with key performance indices
* Add an item to the top navigation ("Performance overview") which displays the performance monitor widget for all your sites (configurable).

###Configuration
*Refresh interval*: Defines how often the widgets will be updated. Every 30 seconds is a good value to choose.

*Measurement period*: Defines the measurement period in minutes. 5 minutes is a good value to choose.

*Comparison period*: Defines the period (x * 24h) the last 30 minutes are compared to. A good value for small sites with more or less static content is 30. For sites with peak days on weekends for example 1 will be a good value. 1 is also a good value for very big sites with a lot of traffic. You will have to play around with this value a little bit and figure out whalt will fit your needs.

*Sites in overview*: Defines which sites are displayed in the overview.  

## Changelog

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/piwik/plugin-QueuedTracking.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/piwik/plugin-QueuedTracking)

## Description

This plugin writes all tracking requests into a [Redis](http://redis.io/) instance instead of directly into the database.
This is useful if you have too many requests per second and your server cannot handle all of them directly (eg too many connections in nginx or MySQL).
It is also useful if you experience peaks sometimes. Those peaks can be handled much better by using this queue.
Writing a tracking request into the queue is very fast (a tracking request takes in total a few milliseconds) compared to a regular tracking request (that takes multiple hundreds of milliseconds). The queue makes sure to process the tracking requests whenever possible even if it takes a while to process all requests after there was a peak.

*This plugin is currently BETA and there might be issues causing not tracked requests, wrongly tracked requests or duplicated tracked requests.*

Have a look at the FAQ for more information.

## FAQ

__What are the requirements for this plugin?__

* [Redis server 2.8+](http://redis.io/) - [Redis quickstart](http://redis.io/topics/quickstart)
* [phpredis PHP extension](https://github.com/nicolasff/phpredis) - [Install](https://github.com/nicolasff/phpredis#installingconfiguring)
* Transactions are used and must be supported by the SQL database.

__Where can I configure and enable the queue?__

In your Piwik instance go to "Settings => Plugin Settings". There is a config section for this plugin.

__When will a queued tracking request be processed?__

First you should know that multiple tracking requests will be inserted into the database at once using
[bulk tracking](http://developer.piwik.org/api-reference/tracking-api#bulk-tracking) as soon as a configurable number
of requests is queued. By default we will check whether enough requests are queued during a regular tracking request
and start processing them right after sending a response to the browser to make sure a user won\'t have to wait until
the queue has finished to process all requests. Have a look at this graph to see how it works:

![How it works](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/piwik/plugin-QueuedTracking/master/docs/How_it_works.png)

__I do not want to process queued requests within a tracking request, what shall I do?__

Don\'t worry, if this solution doesn\'t work out for you for some reason you can disable it and process all queued
requests using the [Piwik console](http://developer.piwik.org/guides/piwik-on-the-command-line). Just follow these steps:

* Disable the setting "Process during tracking request" in the Piwik UI under "Settings => Plugin Settings"
* Setup a cronjob that executes the command `./console queuedtracking:process` for instance every minute
* That\'s it

The `queuedtracking:process` command will make sure to process all queued tracking requests whenever possible and the
command will exit as soon as there are not enough requests queued anymore. That\'s why you should setup a cronjob to start
the command every minute as it will just start processing again as soon as there are enough requests. Be aware that it won\'t
speed up processing queued requests when starting this command multiple times. Only one process will actually replay
queued requests at a time.

Example crontab entry that starts the processor every minute:

`* * * * * cd /piwik && ./console queuedtracking:process >/dev/null 2>&1`

__Can I keep track of the state of the queue?__

Yes, you can. Just execute the command `./console queuedtracking:monitor`. This will show the current state of the queue.

__Can I improve the speed of inserting requests from the Redis queue to the database?__

Yes, you can by adding more workers. By default only one worker is activated at a time and only one worker processes tracking requests from Redis to the database. When inserting tracking requests into the database, at time of writing this, about 80% of the time is spent in PHP and the database might be rather bored. If you have multiple CPUs available on your server you can add more workers. You can do this by going in the Piwik Admin interface to "Plugin Settings". There will be a setting "Number of queue workers". Increase this number to the number of CPUs you want to dedeciate for processing requests. Best practice is to add more workers step by step. So first increase this number to 2 and check if the tracking request insertions is fast enough for you. If not and you have more CPUs available, increase the number again.

When using multiple workers it might be worth to lower the number of "Number of requests to process" to eg 15 in "Plugin Settings". By default 25 requests are inserted in one step by using transactions. This means different workers might have to wait for each other. By lowering that number each worker will block the DB for less time.

If you process requests from the command line via `./console queuedtracking:process` make sure to always start enough workers. Each time you execute this command one worker will be started. If already enough workers are in process no new worker will be started and the command just finishes immediately.

__How fast are the requests inserted from Redis to the Database?__

This very much depends on your setup and hardware. With fast CPUs you can achive up to 250req/s with 1 worker, 400req/s with 2 workers and 1500req/s with 8 workers (tested on a AWS c3.x2large instance).

__How should the redis server be configured?__

Make sure to have enough memory to save all tracking requests in the queue. One tracking request in the queue takes about 2KB,
20.000 tracking requests take about 50MB. All tracking requests of all websites are stored in the same queue.
There should be only one Redis server to make sure the data will be replayed in the same order as they were recorded.
If you want to configure Redis HA (High Availability) it should be possible to use Redis Cluser, Redis Sentinel, ...
We currently write into the Redis default database by default but you can configure to use a different one.

__Why do some tests fail on my local Piwik instance?__

Make sure the requirements mentioned above are met and Redis needs to run on 127.0.0.1:6379 with no password for the
integration tests to work. It will use the database "15" and the tests may flush all data it contains. Make sure
it does not contain any important data.

__What if I want to disable the queue?__

You might want to disable the queue at some point but there are still some pending requests in the queue. We recommend to
change the "Number of requests to process" in plugin settings to "1" and process all requests using the command
`./console queuedtracking:process` shortly before disabling the queue and directly afterwards. It is still possible to
process remaining request once the queue is disabled but new tracking requests won\'t be written into the queue.

__How can I access Redis data?__

You can either acccess data on the command line via `redis-cli` or use a Redis monitor like [phpRedisAdmin](https://github.com/ErikDubbelboer/phpRedisAdmin).
In case you are using something like a Redis monitor make sure it is not accessible by everyone.

__The processor won\'t start processing again as it things another processor is processing the data already, what can I do?__

First make sure there is actually no processor processing any requests. For example by executing the command
`./console queuedtracking:monitor`. In case you are using the command line to process tracking requests make sure there
is no processer running using the Linux command `ps`. If you are sure there is no process running you can release the lock
by executing the command `./console queuedtracking:lock-status`. This will output more information which locks are in use and how to unlock them. Afterwards everything should work as normal again.
You should actually never have to do this as a lock automatically expires after a while. It just may take a while depending
on the amount of requests you are importing.

__How can I test my Redis / QueuedTracking setup in case I\'m getting errors?__

There is a command to test some the connection to Redis as well as some needed features: `./console queuedtracking:test`.

It might directly give you an error message if something goes wrong that helps you to resolve the issue. If your queue
is always locked you might be as well interested in executing `.console queuedtracking:lock-status`.

__How can I debug in case something goes wrong?__

* Use the command `./console queuedtracking:monitor` to view the current state of all workers
* Use the command `./console queuedtracking:lock-status` to view the current state of all locks
* Set the option `-vvv` when processing via `./console queuedtracking:process -vvv` to enable the tracker debug mode for this run. This will print detailed information to screen.
* Enable tracker mode in `config.ini.php` via `[Tracker] debug=1` if processing requests during tracking is enabled.
* Use the command `./console queuedtracking:print-queued-requests` to view the next requests to process in each queue. If you execute this command twice within 1-10 minutes, and it outputs the same, the queue is not being processed most likely indicating a problem.

__I am using the Log Importer in combination with Queued Tracking, is there something to consider?__

Yes, we recommend to set the "Number of requests to process" to `1` as the log importer usually sends multiple requests at once using bulk tracking already.

__Are there any known issues?__

* In case you are using bulk tracking the bulk tracking response varies compared to the regular one. We will always return
 either an image or a 204 HTTP response code in case the parameter `send_image=0` is sent.
* Anything related with Cookies won\'t work
* By design this plugin can delay the insertion of tracking requests causing real time plugins to not show the actual data since
 under load tracking requests may take a while until they are replayed.

<li><a href="https://github.com/nicolasff/phpredis">phpredis PHP extension</a> - <a href="https://github.com/nicolasff/phpredis#installingconfiguring">Install</a></li>
<li>Transactions are used and must be supported by the SQL database.</li>
</ul><p><strong>Where can I configure and enable the queue?</strong></p>

<p>In your Piwik instance go to "Settings =&gt; Plugin Settings". There is a config section for this plugin.</p>

<p><strong>When will a queued tracking request be processed?</strong></p>

<p>First you should know that multiple tracking requests will be inserted into the database at once using
<a href="http://developer.piwik.org/api-reference/tracking-api#bulk-tracking">bulk tracking</a> as soon as a configurable number
of requests is queued. By default we will check whether enough requests are queued during a regular tracking request
and start processing them right after sending a response to the browser to make sure a user won\'t have to wait until
the queue has finished to process all requests. Have a look at this graph to see how it works:</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/piwik/plugin-QueuedTracking/master/docs/How_it_works.png" alt="How_it_works.png" /></p>

<p><strong>I do not want to process queued requests within a tracking request, what shall I do?</strong></p>

<p>Don\'t worry, if this solution doesn\'t work out for you for some reason you can disable it and process all queued
requests using the <a href="http://developer.piwik.org/guides/piwik-on-the-command-line">Piwik console</a>. Just follow these steps:</p>

<ul><li>Disable the setting "Process during tracking request" in the Piwik UI under "Settings =&gt; Plugin Settings"</li>
<li>Setup a cronjob that executes the command <code>./console queuedtracking:process</code> for instance every minute</li>
<li>That\'s it</li>
</ul><p>The <code>queuedtracking:process</code> command will make sure to process all queued tracking requests whenever possible and the
command will exit as soon as there are not enough requests queued anymore. That\'s why you should setup a cronjob to start
the command every minute as it will just start processing again as soon as there are enough requests. Be aware that it won\'t
speed up processing queued requests when starting this command multiple times. Only one process will actually replay
queued requests at a time.</p>

<p>Example crontab entry that starts the processor every minute:</p>

<p><code>* * * * * cd /piwik &amp;&amp; ./console queuedtracking:process &gt;/dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1</code></p>

<p><strong>Can I keep track of the state of the queue?</strong></p>

<p>Yes, you can. Just execute the command <code>./console queuedtracking:monitor</code>. This will show the current state of the queue.</p>

<p><strong>Can I improve the speed of inserting requests from the Redis queue to the database?</strong></p>

<p>Yes, you can by adding more workers. By default only one worker is activated at a time and only one worker processes tracking requests from Redis to the database. When inserting tracking requests into the database, at time of writing this, about 80% of the time is spent in PHP and the database might be rather bored. If you have multiple CPUs available on your server you can add more workers. You can do this by going in the Piwik Admin interface to "Plugin Settings". There will be a setting "Number of queue workers". Increase this number to the number of CPUs you want to dedeciate for processing requests. Best practice is to add more workers step by step. So first increase this number to 2 and check if the tracking request insertions is fast enough for you. If not and you have more CPUs available, increase the number again.</p>

<p>When using multiple workers it might be worth to lower the number of "Number of requests to process" to eg 15 in "Plugin Settings". By default 25 requests are inserted in one step by using transactions. This means different workers might have to wait for each other. By lowering that number each worker will block the DB for less time.</p>

<p>If you process requests from the command line via <code>./console queuedtracking:process</code> make sure to always start enough workers. Each time you execute this command one worker will be started. If already enough workers are in process no new worker will be started and the command just finishes immediately.</p>

<p><strong>How fast are the requests inserted from Redis to the Database?</strong></p>

<p>This very much depends on your setup and hardware. With fast CPUs you can achive up to 250req/s with 1 worker, 400req/s with 2 workers and 1500req/s with 8 workers (tested on a AWS c3.x2large instance).</p>

<p><strong>How should the redis server be configured?</strong></p>

<p>Make sure to have enough memory to save all tracking requests in the queue. One tracking request in the queue takes about 2KB,
20.000 tracking requests take about 50MB. All tracking requests of all websites are stored in the same queue.
There should be only one Redis server to make sure the data will be replayed in the same order as they were recorded.
If you want to configure Redis HA (High Availability) it should be possible to use Redis Cluser, Redis Sentinel, ...
We currently write into the Redis default database by default but you can configure to use a different one.</p>

<p><strong>Why do some tests fail on my local Piwik instance?</strong></p>

<p>Make sure the requirements mentioned above are met and Redis needs to run on 127.0.0.1:6379 with no password for the
integration tests to work. It will use the database "15" and the tests may flush all data it contains. Make sure
it does not contain any important data.</p>

<p><strong>What if I want to disable the queue?</strong></p>

<p>You might want to disable the queue at some point but there are still some pending requests in the queue. We recommend to
change the "Number of requests to process" in plugin settings to "1" and process all requests using the command
<code>./console queuedtracking:process</code> shortly before disabling the queue and directly afterwards. It is still possible to
process remaining request once the queue is disabled but new tracking requests won\'t be written into the queue.</p>

<p><strong>How can I access Redis data?</strong></p>

<p>You can either acccess data on the command line via <code>redis-cli</code> or use a Redis monitor like <a href="https://github.com/ErikDubbelboer/phpRedisAdmin">phpRedisAdmin</a>.
In case you are using something like a Redis monitor make sure it is not accessible by everyone.</p>

<p><strong>The processor won\'t start processing again as it things another processor is processing the data already, what can I do?</strong></p>

<p>First make sure there is actually no processor processing any requests. For example by executing the command
<code>./console queuedtracking:monitor</code>. In case you are using the command line to process tracking requests make sure there
is no processer running using the Linux command <code>ps</code>. If you are sure there is no process running you can release the lock
by executing the command <code>./console queuedtracking:lock-status</code>. This will output more information which locks are in use and how to unlock them. Afterwards everything should work as normal again.
You should actually never have to do this as a lock automatically expires after a while. It just may take a while depending
on the amount of requests you are importing.</p>

<p><strong>How can I test my Redis / QueuedTracking setup in case I\'m getting errors?</strong></p>

<p>There is a command to test some the connection to Redis as well as some needed features: <code>./console queuedtracking:test</code>.</p>

<p>It might directly give you an error message if something goes wrong that helps you to resolve the issue. If your queue
is always locked you might be as well interested in executing <code>.console queuedtracking:lock-status</code>.</p>

<p><strong>How can I debug in case something goes wrong?</strong></p>

<ul><li>Use the command <code>./console queuedtracking:monitor</code> to view the current state of all workers</li>
<li>Use the command <code>./console queuedtracking:lock-status</code> to view the current state of all locks</li>
<li>Set the option <code>-vvv</code> when processing via <code>./console queuedtracking:process -vvv</code> to enable the tracker debug mode for this run. This will print detailed information to screen.</li>
<li>Enable tracker mode in <code>config.ini.php</code> via <code>[Tracker] debug=1</code> if processing requests during tracking is enabled.</li>
<li>Use the command <code>./console queuedtracking:print-queued-requests</code> to view the next requests to process in each queue. If you execute this command twice within 1-10 minutes, and it outputs the same, the queue is not being processed most likely indicating a problem.</li>
</ul><p><strong>I am using the Log Importer in combination with Queued Tracking, is there something to consider?</strong></p>

<p>Yes, we recommend to set the "Number of requests to process" to <code>1</code> as the log importer usually sends multiple requests at once using bulk tracking already.</p>

<p><strong>Are there any known issues?</strong></p>

<ul><li>In case you are using bulk tracking the bulk tracking response varies compared to the regular one. We will always return
either an image or a 204 HTTP response code in case the parameter <code>send_image=0</code> is sent.</li>
<li>Anything related with Cookies won\'t work</li>
<li>By design this plugin can delay the insertion of tracking requests causing real time plugins to not show the actual data since
under load tracking requests may take a while until they are replayed.</li>

## Description

This [Piwik](http://piwik.org) Plugin lets you hide custom date range selection from calendar for regular users,
also lets you avoid users setting ranges as default value in their profile.

Each time users asks for ranged date reports, Piwik builds it on the fly during user\'s browsing.
This slows down your server when there is a load of visits and a large number of tracked websites.
As you can see this action is resource intensive so when it happens, live websites tracking may become slow or inaccurate.

Installing this plugin you remove choices in the field _"Report date to load by default"_ in _User Settings page_ for all regular users.
Superadmin users setting page remains untouched and administrators will see only a notification about plugin\'s current behavior.

Another plugin\'s feature is regular users can\'t select any more a custom range in the calendar but Superadmins still can build reports.

You can enable or disable the two features independently by clicking checkboxes in the plugin\'s configuration page available in the super admin user interface.

This plugin is translated in: English, Italian and French (just send a pull request to include your favourite language, see _Can I contribute_ f.a.q.)

## Installation

Please, read official [Piwik\'s documentation](http://piwik.org/faq/plugins/#faq_21) about it.

## Description

We highly recommend that all Piwik administrators enable the SecurityInfo plugin, and then view the Settings. The plugin is a tool in a multilayered security approach.

Performed checks include for instance usage of latest PHP version, usage of latest Piwik version, usage of PHP ini settings like magic_quotes_gpc and more. 

## FAQ

__Does the plugin replace secure development practices or audit the code/application?__

No, it doesn\'t. It just gives you some information based on PhpSecInfo from the PHP Security Consortium.

## Changelog

1.0 Initial release

## Support

Please direct any feedback to [hello@piwik.org](mailto:hello@piwik.org)

## Description

Use [Piwik](http://piwik.org/) as your analytics platform for statistics collected by [Munin server monitoring](http://munin-monitoring.org/) tool. 

This is a [Piwik](http://piwik.org/) plugin that reads the raw RRD files from your Munin master server. 

This enhances the Munin functionality by providing all the great benefits of Piwik, such as
 
* Real time data
* Customizable Dashboards
* Enhanced Graphing
* Access Munin data using Piwik API
* TODO: Access Munin data using Piwik Mobile
* TODO: Scheduled reports 
* TODO: Custom alerts for Server Monitoring - using [Piwik CustomAlerts plugin](https://github.com/piwik/plugin-CustomAlerts) 

## Screenshots

Login Shibboleth replaces the default Piwik Login plug-in and offers the user a way to incorporate existing Shibboleth with Piwik.

# Pre-Requirement
To use this plug-in you should have the following pre-requirements set:
- Your Shibboleth system is up and running and is connected to apache.
- You can access some data from $\\_SERVER so, you can read user data from $\\_SERVER.
- If you want to combine Shibboleth with LDAP, you should have php5-ldap or your distribution version of php-ldap installed.
- You are familiar with PHP coding, so you can change the custom parameters and function to suite your system.
- You follow the same user Model as Piwik. If you change the user Model to contain some extra informations, you should also change this plug-in\'s handling on the way users are created.
- This plug-in supports the following user informations retrieval:
  - username (login)
  - email
  - alias (name or fullname)
  - token (random string length 32chars)
  - websites (access_level and websites id)

# Configuration
For the configuration following settings should be set in config/config.ini.php

## Datasource:

```
[datasource]  
datasource["alias"] = "shib"  
datasource["login"] = "shib"
datasource["email"] = "shib"
datasource["websites"] = "shib, ldap"
datasource["superuser"] = "shib"
```

The datasource helps you to change the way this plug-in accesses the information needed to generate or add users to Piwik. Normally Shibboleth (shib) should suffice. The software will look at the options in config.ini.php as it is ordered. If you want Shibboleth to prevail, add it first. If your first choice for an option is LDAP add (ldap) first. The MySQL database will automatically comes to help if none of the options give a valid result, which is most of the time unlikely. if your User Model is different, you can set other options here. If you use other resources than this tree, you can also define it here and the use the AuthLib class as parent class and extend it to your own Model.

## Shib:

```
[shib]
shib["login"] = "uid"
shib["alias"] = "fullName"
shib["email"] = "mail"
shib["superuser"] = "groupMembership"
shib["superuser_type"] = "string"
shib["superuser_param"] = "cn=RZ-Piwik-Admin"
shib["to_get_view"] = "groupMembership"
shib["to_get_view_type"] = "string"
shib["to_get_view_param"] = "cn=RZ-Piwik-View"
shib["to_get_admin"] = "groupMembership"
shib["to_get_admin_type"] = "string"
shib["to_get_admin_param"] = "cn=RZ-Piwik-View"
```

In shib you can set the Shibboleth parameter in which user data is caught. if you have some other settings it is possible to set them here. The information would be available in Shibboleth class.

## LDAP:

```
[ldap]
ldap["host"] = "ldaphost"
ldap["port"] = 636
ldap["user"] = "binduser"
ldap["password"] = "bindpassword"
ldap["dn"] = "binddn"
ldap["to_filter_view"] = "(userfilter)"
ldap["to_get_view"] = "website attr"
ldap["to_get_type_view"] = "string"
ldap["to_filter_admin"] = ""
ldap["to_get_admin"] = ""
ldap["to_get_type_admin"] = ""
```

The same applies here just like the Shibboleth settings above.

## Apache Settings
To exclude the public part of piwik, mainly the tracker and piwik.php from the Shibboleth Auth, the following settings have been set in apache VirtualHost.

###Apache 2.2
```
<LocationMatch "^/(?!piwik.js|piwik.php|opt_out.php)">
        AuthType shibboleth
        ShibRequireSession On
        require shibboleth
        require valid-user
        satisfy any
</LocationMatch>
```

###Apache 2.4
```
<LocationMatch "^/(?!piwik.js|piwik.php|opt_out.php)">
        AuthType Shibboleth
        ShibrequestSetting requireSession 1
        Require valid-user
        satisfy all
</LocationMatch>
```

## Description

Plugin allows to turn Piwik instance into URL Shortener.

Basic features:

* easily create shortcode from any page you track in Piwik (integration with Actions report UI),
* create shortcode for any custom URL you want,
* perform redirects using your Piwik instance,
* get usage statistics for shortcodes handled by your instance
    * get best performing URL\'s on websites you track,
    * external URLs redirect statistics,
* see which URLs are being shortened and visited most often - also for external URLs not tracked in your Piwik.

Goodness coming:

* for redirect performance improvement, store your shortcodes in storage like Memcache or Redis,
* attributing shortcode redirects with actual visits on your page,
* more advanced reports,

Before using, please read content in [`Setup`](https://github.com/mgazdzik/plugin-ShortcodeTracker#setup) section 
as it contains steps required to make plugin work with your Piwik instance!

## Usage

After correctly setting up this plugin (please see section below), you are ready for shortening your Urls.

There is one new section in top reporting menu called "Shortcodes".

This view gives you possibility to shorten any URL you want and operate with shortcode retrieved.

Additionally this plugin integrates with Page URL\'s report - hover over URL you want to shorten and click scissors icon.

This will call popup with appropriate shortcode, so you don\'t need to manually shorten any URL you already track with your
Piwik instance.

Enjoy!

## Setup

### Webserver
Besides of functional Piwik instance with this plugin enabled you will also need special configuration for your webserver.

It\'s purpose is to redirect any short url hitting your server to proper API method doing the magic.

Below you can find example configurations

* [for NGINX webserver vhost](docs/nginx_config.md)
* [for Apache2 webserver .htaccess file](docs/apache_config.md)

**Please be aware that in your case this configuration may be different, so please contact your system/webserver
admin for advisory!**


### Plugin

Before you can start shortening your URLs you need to perform following steps:

* go to Administration -> Plugins,
* find "ShortcodeTracker" plugin and click `enable`,

After you confirm that plugin has been enabled:
* go to Administration -> Plugin Settings,
* go to ShortcodeTracker section,
* fill in Shortener URL input,
* if you want to track external sites, you need to decide to which Piwik page those actions will be attributed (see
External redirects tracking section below),
* click \'save\',
* **additionally you have to make Shortener URL a trusted host for Piwik by entering it in settings section**,

This is necessary to perform, as otherwise you will not be able to generate shortened URLs or use them with Piwik.

### External redirects tracking

It is possible to also track redirect actions for external URLs (i.e. which URL doesn\'t match any page tracked within
your Piwik instance). However, it is required to decide to which site this traffic will be attributed to.

It is recommended to create a separate Website in Piwik instance only dedicated to this traffic, so that other websites
reports won\'t be affected by redirect events.

To select which site should collect redirects:

* go to `Plugin Settings` section,
* from dropdown you can select site for external redirects,
* alternatively you can select not to track external redirects by setting `Do not collect external shortcode redirects`,
* click save

## Description

This plugin shows how much load your webserver does have, where Piwik (and maybe your main website) is running. Additionally the free or the used memory will be displayed.

The display will be refreshed automatically as often as you like. This can be setup by yourself in the plugin settings.

## Changelog

* **0.1.0 Initial release**

  * Additional to the percentage values, the real values are display on hover 


## FAQ

**How is the CPU load calculated?**  
For the CPU load the PHP function sys_getloadavg() is used and divided by the number of cores.
  
**Why is there a difference between free and used memory?**  
There are three "memory parts" under Linux:   

* Used memory
* Cache
* Free memory
  
The sum of these three parts will be equal to the total memory. But only `used memory` and `free memory` are available as options (in settings).
  
**What is the value for 100% network traffic**  
You can setup the value for the maximum network traffic in the plugin system settings. The value there must be specified in kB/s (kilobyte per second). This value is used as 100% network traffic.
  
**Does the plugin work on a shared webspace?**  
In the most cases a shared webspace doesn\'t have access to system information. Therefore in these cases, the plugin cannot be used. The pseudo file system /proc must be accessible.
  
**Does the plugin work on Windows system?**  
If the server where Piwik is running is using Windows as OS, the plugin doesn\'t work yet.  
If just your browser is running under Windows (and the server runs under Linux) this plugin works well.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/PiwikPRO/plugin-SiteMigration.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/PiwikPRO/plugin-SiteMigration)

## Description

Migrate websites, and all the tracking data between two Piwik installations. 

This tool is useful in case you want to merge two Piwik installations, or if you want to move one or several websites to another Piwik server.

### Requirements

To migrate data from one Piwik server to another server, you must:

 * First make sure that both Piwik servers are using the latest Piwik version.
 * You must be able to connect to the Mysql server of the Target Piwik Server.
 * You must run the console command on the Piwik Server that data will be copied from.
  
### Migrating the data

Start the migration by calling from the command line CLI the following command:

    ./console migration:site idSite --db-prefix piwik_
    
The command will ask for the credentials to the target database.
 
It will then migrate the data from the current Piwik to the target Piwik.

### Options

Run `./console migration:site --help` to get a full list of options.
 
## FAQ

**How do I migrate site data between two dates only?**

You can use command options: `--date-from` and `--date-to`.

**How do I migrate tracking log data only, and skip migrating archived data?**

Just add the `--skip-archive-data` option.


**How do I migrate the archived data and skip the tracking data?**

Just add the `--skip-log-data` option.

**Can I run the command on the Target Piwik server (where data will be imported)?**

No, you must run the command from the source Piwik server (the server which contains the data you want to migrate).

## Description

Snoopy is a User behaviour scoring plugin for piwik. It allows you to score your visitors depending on goals reached, pages visited, email campaigns opened and other factors. In other words this plugin enables you to score your visitors based on actions they do on your website. It has a robust scoring methodology for heating and cooling visitor score.

Snoopy also provides some basic API functions to integrate it with third party applications souch as your CRM or lead management system. More information about the API can be found on [github wiki](https://github.com/spletnik/snoopy-behavioral-scoring/wiki/API).

## Installation
### Automatic
Install it via Piwik Marketplace and [configure](#configuration) plugin.
### Manual installation
1. Download whole repository as ZIP.
2. Go to your piwik Administration => Marketplace and click on "upload a plugin in .zip format."
3. After plugin is upladed press "Activate plugin"

If you did everything correct and you have sufficient permissions on folder plugins, Snoopy should be successfully installed.

Now all you need to do is to set your configuration and create a cron that calculates visitors scores.

## Configuration

### Required
Before Snoopy starts scoring visitors you first have to tweak some configuration to match your needs.

1. Matching site:
You have to select for which site your Snoopy scores visitors. For now only one website property tracking is available.

2. Matching goal:
Snoopy will start scoring only when specific goal is achieved. You can choose one or more goals as entry point to start .ing.

3. Cooling factor:
Cooling factor is number that tells you how fast visitors will loose their score.

Here is example simulation for factor 1.1

|Number of inactive days|Current penalty|Penalty since beginning|Visitor scores	|
|-----------------------|---------------|-----------------------|---------------|
|						|				|						|	100		  	|
|	1					|	1			|	1					|	99		  	|
|	2					|	1.1			|	2.1					|	97.9		|
|	3					|	1.21		|	3.31				|	96.69		|
|	4					|	1.331		|	4.641				|	95.359		|
|	5					|	1.4641		|	6.1051				|	93.8949		|
|	6					|	1.61051		|	7.71561				|	92.28439	|
|	7					|	1.771561	|	9.487171			|	90.512829	|
|	8					|	1.9487171	|	11.4358881			|	88.5641119	|
|	9					|	2.14358881	|	13.57947691			|	86.42052309	|
|	10					|	2.357947691	|	15.9374246			|	84.0625754	|

From the table you can see that on first inactive day you loose 1 point, 
on the  second inactive day you loose 1*factor point
on third inactive day you loose second_day*factor point etc.

Those configuration parameters are mandatory for Snoopy to score propperly. 

When you are finished with configuration you just need to put this comand as your cronjob and Snoopy will start to calculate your score (This will recalcualte score hourly):

**0 * * * * /piwik_root/console snoopybehavioralscoring:recalculate-score**

Additionally you can pipe log to file:

**0 * * * * /piwik_root/console snoopybehavioralscoring:recalculate-score >> /var/log/snoopy.log**

### Optional
- Enable console full debug

When running recalculate-score some additional info is printed, that could be usefull when debuging why score is not calculated properly.

- Campaign entry bonus

Bonus score that is added when visitor visits your webpage trough campaign (Google Analytics campaign parameters are set)
- Special URL\'s

URL;SCORE pairs that make some of your URL\'s worth more score points. 

For example:

http://example.com/contact;3

Here contact page is worth 3 points instead just one.
## FAQ

__When does my visitors gets scored.__

When they reach specified goal in plugin settings.

## Description

This is a plugin for the Open Source Web Analytics platform Piwik. If enabled, it will add a new widget that you can add to your dashboard.

The widget will show the top performing pages of a site that auto-refreshes every x seconds. It shows the number of actions and the title of the page. It is auto-sorting the entries.

**This plugin should run fine with installations with up to 100.000 page impressions per day. If you run a very large piwik installation and have performance issues with this plugin, please contact me - there is a solution for this. I have it up and running in an installation with more than 10 million visits per day.**

(Tested with piwik 2.8.3, but supposed to run with older versions)

## Installation

1. Clone the plugin into the plugins directory of your Piwik installation.

   ```

2. Login as superuser into your Piwik installation and activate the plugin under Settings -> Plugins

Tracking Code Customizer plugin for the Piwik Web Analytics software package

##Description
Allows Piwik admininstrators to customize the tracking code that is autogenerated for users. This is useful for directing requests to the correct servers in a multi-server setup, include additional parameters in default tracking, or to perform conditional checks before initiating a tracking call. 

##Instructions
The easiest way to install is to find the plugin in the [Piwik Marketplace](http://plugins.piwik.org/).

##Usage

Set additional default OPTIONS for tracking. The follwing is entered into the "options" field.

```javascript
if (typeof(hash) !== \'undefined\'){_paq.push([\'setCustomVariable\',\'1\',\'U\',hash,\'visit\']); _paq.push([\'setUserId\',hash]);};
```
Resultant tracking code
```javascript
<!-- Piwik -->
<script type="text/javascript">
  var _paq = _paq || [];
  if (typeof(hash) !== \'undefined\'){_paq.push([\'setCustomVariable\',\'1\',\'U\',hash,\'visit\']); _paq.push([\'setUserId\',hash]);};
  _paq.push([\'trackPageView\']);
  _paq.push([\'enableLinkTracking\']);
  var u="//webanalytics-tracker.XXXX.XXX/";
_paq.push([\'setTrackerUrl\', u+\'piwik.php\']);
    _paq.push([\'setSiteId\', 1]);
    var d=document, g=d.createElement(\'script\'), s=d.getElementsByTagName(\'script\')[0];
    g.type=\'text/javascript\'; g.async=true; g.defer=true; g.src=u+\'piwik.js\'; s.parentNode.insertBefore(g,s);
  })();
</script>

TreemapVisualization contains a new report visualization that will display your reports as tiles of different sizes and will show you how each metric has changed from the last period.

The treemap visualization displays rows of data as squares whose size corresponds to a metric in each row.

If you\'re looking at the visits in a report, the row with the most visits will take up the most space. Just like other graph visualizations, **you can use it to easily see which rows have the largest values**. The treemap differs from other graphs though, in that **it can show many more rows**.

#### Treemap colors for comparison with previous period

The treemap visualization will also show you one thing that no other visualization included with Piwik does: the **evolution** of each row. Hovering over a treemap square will show you how much the row changed from the last period (ie, the last day, week, etc.).

Each treemap square is colored based on the evolution value **so you can easily see how your data is changing**. A red square means the change is negative; a green square means the change is positive. The more green the bigger the change; the more red the smaller the change.

#### Known limitations

* Treemaps will not work with flattened tables. Currently, if a table is flattened, the treemap icon will be removed.
* Evolution values cannot be calculated for subtables (reports that are displayed when you click on a row or node).

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/piwik/plugin-VisitorGenerator.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/piwik/plugin-VisitorGenerator)

## Description

Plugin to create fake visits, websites, users and goals. This can be used by Piwik users or developers as an easy way to generate fake data to populate Piwik reports.

You can overwrite the log files that are used to generate fake visits in [plugins/VisitorGenerator/data](https://github.com/piwik/plugin-VisitorGenerator/blob/master/data) or add new logs to the `data` directory. All files ending with `*.log` will be replayed.

Plugin developers can provide their own log files by placing \'*.log\' files within a \'data\' directory of their plugin. This way plugin developers make sure there will be always useful test data.

### Usage 

#### UI
The plugin adds a new item to the Piwik admin UI visible only for users having Super User access under the section "Development". There you can select a site and for how many days in the past you want to generate new visits.

#### CLI
It also adds the following commands to the [Piwik CLI tool](http://developer.piwik.org/guides/piwik-on-the-command-line):

* Generate visits
* Generate goals
* Generate users
* Generate websites
* Generate annotation
* Shorten log file
* Anonymize log file

##### Examples
* `./console visitorgenerator:generate-annotation --idsite 5` generate one annotation for the current day for site with id 5
* `./console visitorgenerator:generate-goals --idsite 5` generates some predefined goals for site with id 5
* `./console visitorgenerator:generate-users --limit 100`  generates 100 users
* `./console visitorgenerator:generate-websites --limit 100` generates 100 websites
* `./console visitorgenerator:generate-visits --idsite 5`  generates many visits for site with id 5 for today
* `./console visitorgenerator:generate-visits --idsite 5 --days 2` generates many visits for site with id 5 for today and yesterday
* `./console visitorgenerator:anonymize-log /path/to/log` takes an Apache log file, anonymizes it and places it in a data directory so it will be replayed the next time "generate-visits" is executed
* `./console visitorgenerator:shorten-log /path/to/file.log > file.short.log` takes a large Apache log file and keeps only a small number of logs per day
* `./console visitorgenerator:generate-visits --idsite 5 --custom-piwik-url=http://example.com/` Uses \'http://example.com/\' as Piwik-URL and generates many visits for site with id 5 for today

## Changelog

- 1.0 Initial release
- 1.1 New features:
   * Added CLI commands
   * Added possibility to generate websites, users and goals
   * Replay all log files within the data directory
- 1.2 New features:
   * New log file added
   * Added possibility to shorten and anonymize log files
   * Added possibility to let plugins define their own log files
   * Added possibility to generate annotations
   * Replay only log entries having the same day of the month
- 1.2.1 New workaround:
   * When force_ssl is enabled, and visits are generated on `localhost`, force to use HTTP instead of HTTPS
- 1.2.3 Minor UI tweaks to make it consistent with Piwik look & feel
